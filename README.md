# Arduino Hardware Projects

This repository is a personal collection of hands-on hardware projects using **Arduino**, various **sensors**, and **electronic modules**. Driven entirely by curiosity and a passion for tinkering, these projects are my way of exploring how the physical world interacts with code.

From basic sensor experiments to more complex systems, every project here reflects a step in my learning journey through the world of embedded systems and DIY electronics.

## ðŸ“š Why This Repo?

Curiosity is the best teacher. This repo is where I document, organize, and reflect on all the cool stuff I build, break, and fix using Arduino. If you're just as curious, feel free to explore or build upon any of these projects!
