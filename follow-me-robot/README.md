# Follow Me Robot ‚Äì Arduino + IR & Rotating Ultrasonic Sensor + 4 Motor Drivers

This project is a "Follow Me" robot built using an **Arduino Uno**, **IR sensors**, a **servo-mounted ultrasonic sensor**, and **four motor driver boards**. The robot detects and follows an object while scanning for obstacles in multiple directions and adjusting its path accordingly.

Built purely out of curiosity, this robot combines motion, distance sensing, and dynamic reaction using simple components.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Working Principle

1. **IR sensors** detect nearby objects or directional signals (like hand movement or reflective tape).
2. A **servo-mounted ultrasonic sensor** rotates to scan surroundings and detect obstacles in multiple directions.
3. The robot uses this sensor data to:
   - Move forward when an object is detected ahead
   - Turn left/right based on IR or sonar input
   - Stop or reverse if obstacles are too close
4. The use of **four motor drivers** gives precise control over each wheel, improving navigation and turning.
