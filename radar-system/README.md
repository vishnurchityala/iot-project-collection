# Radar System ‚Äì Arduino Ultrasonic Sensor with Java Swing Visualization

This project is a simple radar-style system that uses an **ultrasonic sensor** mounted on a **servo motor** to scan its surroundings. The distance data is read by an **Arduino Uno**, and then visualized in real-time using a **Java Swing GUI**.

Inspired purely by curiosity, this was an exploration into combining embedded hardware and desktop applications for interactive sensor-based systems.

## Working Principle

1. The servo motor sweeps from 0¬∞ to 180¬∞, rotating the ultrasonic sensor.
2. At each step, the sensor measures distance and sends it to the Arduino.
3. Arduino sends angle-distance data to the PC via Serial.
4. A **Java Swing application** reads this serial data and plots a radar-like interface showing object positions in real-time.
